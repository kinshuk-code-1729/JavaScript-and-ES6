# JavaScript-and-ES6
This repository coantains the different concepts of JavaScript and ECMA Script 6 which I've learnt while learning JS.

## JavaScript :
- **JavaScript (JS)** is a lightweight interpreted (or _just-in-time_ compiled) programming language with _first-class functions_. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as **Node.js**, **Apache CouchDB** and **Adobe Acrobat**. JavaScript is a _prototype-based_, multi-paradigm, **single-threaded**, _**dynamic**_ language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
- JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via _**eval**_ ), object introspection (via **_for...in_** and **_Object_ utilities**), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through **_toString_**( )).

## Features of JavaScript :
- All popular web browsers support **JavaScript** as they provide _built-in execution_ environments.
- **JavaScript** follows the syntax and structure of the **C programming language**. Thus, it is a **structured** programming language.
- **JavaScript** is a _weakly typed_ language, where certain types are _implicitly cast_ (depending on the operation).
- **JavaScript** is an **_object-oriented_** programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
- It is a **light-weighted** and interpreted language.
- It is a **case-sensitive** language.
- **JavaScript** is supportable in several operating systems including _Windows, macOS,_ etc.
- It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.

## Applications of JavaScript :
_JavaScript is used to create interactive websites._

_It is mainly used for :_
- Client-side validation.
- Dynamic drop-down menus.
- Displaying date and time.
- Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),
- Displaying clocks etc.
