# JavaScript-and-ES6
This repository coantains the different concepts of JavaScript and ECMA Script 6 which I've learnt while learning JS.

## JavaScript :
- **JavaScript (JS)** is a lightweight interpreted (or _just-in-time_ compiled) programming language with _first-class functions_. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as **Node.js**, **Apache CouchDB** and **Adobe Acrobat**. JavaScript is a _prototype-based_, multi-paradigm, **single-threaded**, _**dynamic**_ language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
- JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via _**eval**_ ), object introspection (via **_for...in_** and **_Object_ utilities**), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through **_toString_**( )).
